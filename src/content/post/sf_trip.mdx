## First Caltrain Journey

I was quite curious before boarding the Caltrain for my first experience with public transportation in the US. Purchasing a ticket or acquiring a Clipper card turned out to be straightforward - you can buy a ticket at any station or download a digital card via the Clipper App.

Upon arriving at the Caltrain station, I immediately noticed the contrast with Chinese high-speed railway stations. Caltrain stations are considerably more open; you don't have to swipe your Clipper card or show your train ticket to access the platform. Although it's possible to board the train without paying, conductors periodically check for valid tickets.

Caltrain features double-decker trains equipped with one or two bike cars. The first level is dedicated to cyclists, making it extremely bike-friendly. As for seating, the second level offers two configurations: a single-seat arrangement with an open view to the lower level, and standard seats accompanied by tables.

I took the Caltrain from California Ave Station to SF Station and back, departing at 7:48AM and returning at 8:57PM on Saturday.

I generally love its convenience, but it's a bit slow, taking more than 1 hour for a 60km trip.

## Berkeley

I took an Uber to Berkeley and enjoyed a brief hour-long tour, wandering around.

It was extremely windy and cold, so please dress more warmly!

## Home

It was very cold at the SF Caltrain Station before I boarded the train at 9 PM.

After arriving at California Ave Station at 10PM, I found it convenient that I had parked my bike next to the platform that morning.
